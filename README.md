# Wing-Load-Subsonic-Transport-Aircraft
These modules provide tools for find the effect of lift and inertial forces on the wing of subsonic transport aircraft.  These modules made by Python and consist of maneuver envelopes, wing nodal forces (shear , bending moment, and torsion), and composite diagram obtains load value in various flight condition.
